# 🧠 My LeetCode Solutions (Python)

Welcome! 👋 This repository contains the coding problems I've solved on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), written in **Python** 🐍.

I created this repo to:

* Practice **data structures and algorithms**
* Track my progress across different problem types
* Write clean, efficient, and well-commented Python solutions
* Build a resource I can revisit for future reference or interviews

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in its own file or directory, typically named using the problem title or ID. The structure is simple and Pythonic:

```
leetcode-python-solutions/
├── 1.Twosum/
│   └── Twosum.py
├── 4.Median Of Two Sorted Array/
    └── medianSortedArray.py

```

Each file includes:

* ✅ **Working Python solution**
* 💡 **Inline comments** to explain logic
* ⏱️ **Time and space complexity**
* 🧪 **Edge case handling**

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

This repo includes solutions to problems involving:

* Arrays & Strings
* Hash Tables & Sets
* Linked Lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Trees (DFS, BFS)
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Sliding Window & Two Pointers
* Binary Search
* Graphs & Union-Find
* Bit Manipulation

## 🐍 Why Only Python?

Python is expressive, clean, and great for focusing on algorithmic thinking without boilerplate. It's also my preferred language for technical interviews and competitive programming.

---

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Browse files by name or topic
2. Each file contains a complete Python function/class
3. Copy-paste into LeetCode to test your own edge cases
4. Optionally, run locally with test cases using `pytest` or plain scripts

---

## 🚧 In Progress

* [ ] Add README explanations for complex problems
* [ ] Group problems by topic
* [ ] Add a table of contents or index file
* [ ] Include difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)

---

## 🙌 Contributions

This is a personal learning project, but:

* You’re welcome to learn from the code
* PRs to fix bugs or suggest better solutions are welcome
* Feel free to open issues for discussions

---

## 💬 Final Note

Whether you're preparing for interviews, brushing up on skills, or just love solving problems — stay consistent and keep going. LeetCode is a marathon, not a sprint. 🚀

---

Let me know if you want to add:

* GitHub badges (e.g., total problems solved)
* A Python virtual environment or testing framework setup
* A CLI to run local test cases against each problem file

Happy problem-solving! 💻🐍
